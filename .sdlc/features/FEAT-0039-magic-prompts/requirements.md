# Requirements: Magic Prompts

## Overview

A library of pre-built, customizable AI prompt templates organized by group (Git, GitHub, Planning, Session) covering commit generation, PR generation, conflict resolution, plan creation/improvement/implementation, session summaries/reviews, and session fusion. Users can override visible prompts and instruction templates via a dedicated settings page.

## Stakeholders

| FR-01 | Must | The system shall provide 30+ pre-built prompt templates organized by group. |
| FR-02 | Must | The system shall support customizing instruction templates per prompt. |
| FR-03 | Must | The system shall support hiding/showing specific prompts. |
| FR-04 | Must | The system shall provide a dedicated settings page for prompt management. |
| FR-05 | Should | The system shall support configurable planning prompts. |
| FR-06 | Should | The system shall power git commit and PR generation via magic prompts. |
| FR-08 | Must | The system shall allow overriding existing prompt templates without supporting creation of entirely new prompt IDs. |
| FR-09 | Must | The system shall ship default templates with each release and layer user overrides on top. |
