# Requirements: Mobile UI & Touch Gestures

## Overview

A comprehensive mobile adaptation layer including edge-swipe to open session switcher, drawer swipe-to-dismiss, long-press context menus, virtual viewport keyboard handling, mobile-specific control buttons, overlay panels for dialogs, and mobile keyboard mode preference.

## Stakeholders

| Stakeholder | Interest |
|---|---|
| Mobile/tablet users | Full app functionality on touch devices |
| PWA users | Native-feeling touch interactions |

## Functional Requirements

| ID | Priority | Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| FR-01 | Must | The system shall provide mobile-optimized chat controls (agent/model buttons, send). |
| FR-02 | Must | The system shall handle virtual keyboard viewport changes gracefully. |
| FR-03 | Must | The system shall support touch gestures: edge-swipe, long-press, swipe-to-dismiss. |
| FR-04 | Must | The system shall provide mobile overlay panels for dialogs and settings. |
| FR-05 | Should | The system shall support mobile keyboard mode preference (resize/overlay). |
| FR-06 | Should | The system shall provide mobile-specific session status bar. |
| FR-07 | Should | The system shall optimize touch targets for finger-sized interactions. |
| FR-08 | Must | The system shall use web-standard touch gesture APIs without platform-specific branching, detecting mobile via pointer type and viewport width. |
| FR-09 | Should | The system shall support configurable PWA orientation (system, portrait, landscape) via settings. |

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] FR-01: Given a mobile device, chat controls are usable with touch
- [ ] FR-02: Given a mobile keyboard appearing, the UI adjusts without overlapping input
- [ ] FR-03: Given edge-swipe from left, the session switcher opens
- [ ] FR-04: Given a dialog or settings panel on mobile, it opens as an overlay panel
- [ ] FR-05: Given mobile keyboard mode setting, the user can choose resize or overlay behavior
- [ ] FR-06: Given a mobile device, a session status bar is visible with relevant information
- [ ] FR-07: Given a touch target on mobile, it meets minimum finger-sized interaction dimensions
- [ ] FR-08: Given touch input, the system uses web-standard APIs with no iOS/Android branching
- [ ] FR-09: Given PWA orientation settings, the user can select system, portrait, or landscape

## Constraints

- Mobile is detected via pointer type and viewport width (768px breakpoint)
