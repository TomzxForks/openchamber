# Requirements: Settings

## Overview

OpenChamber provides a comprehensive settings interface with 19 pages covering all aspects of the application: appearance, chat behavior, notifications, sessions, keyboard shortcuts, git identities, magic prompts, projects, remote instances, agents, behavior, commands, MCP servers, providers, usage, skills, voice, and tunnel configuration. Settings persist across sessions and sync with the OpenCode server.

## Stakeholders

| Stakeholder | Interest |
|---|---|
| All users | Personalize the app experience |
| Power users | Fine-tune agent behavior, shortcuts, and tool permissions |
| Teams | Configure shared providers, MCP servers, and project settings |

## Functional Requirements

| ID | Priority | Requirement |

## Non-Functional Requirements

| ID | Priority | Category | Requirement |
|---|---|---|---|
| NFR-01 | Must | Accessibility | Settings shall be navigable via keyboard and screen reader. |
| NFR-02 | Should | Usability | Collapsible sidebar groups for organizing settings pages. |

## Constraints

- OpenCode SDK provides per-project config via `opencode.json`, but OpenChamber's own settings are machine-level
- Settings UI uses shared primitives from `packages/ui/src/components/sections/shared/`
- Each settings section is a separate component under `packages/ui/src/components/sections/`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] FR-01: Given the settings dialog, all 19 pages are accessible via sidebar navigation
- [ ] FR-02: Given a setting change, it persists after app restart
- [ ] FR-03: Given each settings page, the relevant options are present and functional
- [ ] FR-04: Given a provider API key change, the OpenCode server receives the update
- [ ] FR-09: Given settings are modified, when the app restarts, they persist from OPENCHAMBER_DATA_DIR/settings.json
- [ ] FR-10: Given a settings section with modified values, when the user triggers reset-to-default, only that section's values are restored
- [ ] FR-05: Given the Shortcuts settings page, the user can view, modify, and reset keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] FR-06: Given a display width larger than 1200px, the settings dialog opens in a windowed layout instead of fullscreen
- [ ] FR-07: Given the settings sidebar, the user can resize it and navigate using keyboard and screen reader
- [ ] FR-08: Given the settings page, the user can export settings to a file and import settings from a file
- [ ] NFR-01: Given the settings dialog, all interactive elements are reachable via keyboard Tab and screen reader announcements are correct
- [ ] NFR-02: Given the settings sidebar, related pages are grouped into collapsible sections
